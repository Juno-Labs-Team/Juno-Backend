Juno is a  rideshare app for making it easier to communicate rideshare info, carpooling, etc.  
You get a stream of upcoming rides (like events/calendar). See everything at a glance, get notifications (Uber-style) about current locations using Google maps API, view ride info, etc.  
Especially useful since students are getting their driver's licenses,
